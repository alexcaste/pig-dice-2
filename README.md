# pig-dice-2

This is an app built by two different teams on two different days.  The teams were not allowed to see each others work or ask each other questions.  This was to test the readability and transferability of our code writing.  

This app works but I was never able to make the dice flash random numbers, as if rolling, to the user before showing the final result.  There needs to be a forced pause between the button press to roll, the random images, and the final result.  Right now the computer is doing the job but it happens too fast for it to render.
